# EasyProject
by Florence Dawagne

## About
This is small script to easily start a Unity projects, by creating folders, materials and so on.
You can access call all functions at once, or call them separately if some of them do not fit your needs.

I made this script for my own use, and decided to share it. I plan on updating it, for my own use.

## How to use
1) Place the script inside an **empty** Unity project, in the main file (Assets).
2) Inside the editor, open the menu, open the EasyProject menu, then select the option you need.
