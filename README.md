# EasyProject
by Florence Dawagne

## About
This is small script to easily start a Unity projects, by creating folders, materials and so on.
You can access call all functions at once, or call them separately if some of them do not fit your needs.

I made this script for my own use, and decided to share it. I plan on updating it, for my own use.
